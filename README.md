# RustLab

This is a library meant to, in the long run, replace MatLab with a faster (or blazingly fast), better to use, tool, with the same capabilities.

For now, we only have a Root Locus editor. To run it, clone the repository, and at its base directory, run 
```cargo run --release```
, and you should be good to go.
