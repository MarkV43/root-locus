# Root Locus Editor

The Root Locus editor is a powerful tool for analyzing the behavior of dynamic systems. It allows for the visualization of the locations of the roots of a system's characteristic equation in the complex plane. 

## Getting Started

To utilize this software, please clone the repository and navigate to the base directory. Then, execute the command `cargo run --release` to initiate the program.

## Features

- **Modes**: The editor allows you to switch between different modes for optimal functionality. The currently available modes are Zoom, Interval, and Precision. These modes allow for adjustments to be made to the plot such as zooming in and out, adjusting the interval between plot points, and adjusting the precision of the root solver.
- **Fit Plot**: Functionality to fit all plot points on the screen is available by pressing the `R` key.
- **Toggle FPS**: You can toggle FPS by pressing the `F` key

## Usage

The editor can be controlled using the following keyboard shortcuts:
- Press `M` to switch between modes (Zoom, Interval and Precision)
- Press `R` to fit all plot points in the screen
- Press `F` to toggle FPS
